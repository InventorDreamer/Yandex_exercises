I am a graduate of the educational organization "Yandex Practicum" specializing in Data Science. Thanks to these courses, I not only gained additional skills in Python programming, ML algorithms, and learned how to analyze data, but I also developed in SQL, which enhances my database management capabilities.

**My hard-skills:**
* Python programming
* SQL
* ML algorithms


* Data analysis

**My soft-skills:**
* Effective communication to clearly convey findings to colleagues and clients
* Adaptability to swiftly adjust to new technologies and industry changes
* Complex problem-solving abilities for tackling data-driven challenges
