I am a graduate of the educational organization "Yandex Practicum" specializing in Data Science. Thanks to these courses, I not only gained additional skills in Python programming, mastered ML algorithms, and learned how to analyze data, but I also developed proficiency in SQL, which enhances my database management capabilities. Additionally, I cultivated a number of important soft skills, including analytical thinking, the ability to solve complex problems, effective communication with colleagues and clients, project management, and adaptability to changes. These skills, combined with my technical knowledge in statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and database management, make me a competent professional capable of making informed decisions based on data.
